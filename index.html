      <h2 id="subtitle">Curiosities about super mario:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Origin of the Name:</strong> Nintendo developers rented a place to live. The owner of the property went to collect the late rent, and his name was Mario Segale.</li>
        <li><strong>First Apparition: </strong>Although the first game was released in 1985, the character appeared in 1981, introduced in the game Donkey Kong.</li>
        <li><strong>Guinness Book:</strong> Super Mario still holds the record for the oldest active video game character. In addition, he is also the character that earned the most games - there are more than 200! Its latest record is related to its reach, as the franchise is the best-selling franchise of all time.</li>
        <li><strong>Character's professions: </strong>Mario was well known for being a plumber, but he was also a pilot, martial artist, athlete, builder, tennis player, football player and also a golfer.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical limitations shaped the design: </strong>According to what some historians have investigated, the mustache was made so that no one could see his mouth, something difficult to model. In addition, the jumpsuit with the strong colors helped to make the movements more visible to whoever was playing.</li>
